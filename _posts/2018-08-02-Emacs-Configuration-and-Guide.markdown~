A detailed note about Emacs installation, configuration in OSX, and its guide.

We all know that Emacs is a very powerful text editor that is flexible, customizable, and extensible. More importantly it can utilize different packages from MELPA to help with text editting. I have noticed that there isn't a detail-oriented note or blog about how to install Emacs through homebrew, configure emacs in OSX, and use it. Therefore, I am going to write a blog for it.

## Emacs Installation
In Mac OSX, there is a default emacs text editor that cannot be updated regularly because it directly comes along as a package from the Mac OSX itself. You have to update the whole operating system in order to get it updated, which, most of the time, is an out-dated version. Therefore, if you want to update emacs regularly, you may want to use the emacs provided by homebrew.

If you want to install homebrew, you can just paste the following command into your terminal and run it:

{% highlight css %}
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

If you have homebrew installed already, you can run the following commands to install homebrew's version of emacs:

{% highlight css %}
$ brew update
{% endhighlight %}
